WEBSITE CONCEPT:

This is a restaurant's website named FOODIE. It allows the user to access the Menu, 
Discounted Great Value Specials, a Contact Us and Sign Up Page. It is a modern design that
includes high quality images and symbols. The goal was to create a website that was easy to use,
straight forward and still holds a modern standard to a user. 

HOME PAGE:

The Home Page shows the restaurant's logo together with a small summary of what the restaurant is about.
Instead of making a basic About Us page, this idea will be better for a customer to have a brief understanding. 
Users can make reservations on the home page and are shown the Great Value Specials upon arrival. 

CONTACT US PAGE:

This shows the contact details for FOODIE including, contact number & email. 
Offers the user to enter their respective Name, Email and the Message they would like to inform FOODIE about.

SIGN UP PAGE:

for future discounts or alerts on specials.
